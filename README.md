# 🖥️  PC Assembly Reflection
> **"Understanding the hardware foundation of modern computing."**

Spent some time getting hands-on with the hardware that actually powers our daily creative grind. From the logic of disassembly to the art of a clean build, there’s a unique satisfaction in mastering the physical side of tech.

As someone usually buried in code and graphics, it’s refreshing to step out from behind the screen and look at the "bones" of the PC. A solid reminder that a great user experience starts with a well-built machine.
